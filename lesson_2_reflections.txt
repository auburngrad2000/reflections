What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a .git directory, and stores metadata about the files.  I need to do it to tell git that I want it to start tracking the files in the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is an intermediate area.  The value is that not all files in the directory may need to be pushed into the repo, and the staging area is a nice palce to vizualize that.
